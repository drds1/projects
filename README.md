# projects
A repository of data science projects. This will be populated with studies on various data sets ranging from the statistics of a tennis match to cancer prediction. Machine learning techniques used in these projects include Kmeans clustering, multi-layer neural networks, K nearest neighbour algorithms, MCMC studies and more. Each project directory contains the relevant code (indivdual subroutines and functions may also be found in the Python_Routines repository) as well as a writeup of the aims, statistical procedure and main conclusions of the analysis.
